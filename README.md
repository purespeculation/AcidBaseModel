# WQM - Water Quality Model

This is a mobile application known as Water Quality Model, based of the models for water quality measurements designed by Issam Najm, Ph.D
It aims to add portability to two water chemistry models, previously only available on spreadsheets. The main screen pictured below presents the two options.

### LSICCPP Model

The LSICCPP allows the user to calculate expected Langlier Saturation Index/calcium carbonate precipitation given data entered from a sample of water.
Once Data is entered and Calculate is pressed, the results will appear, as on the right.

If the user ticked the Detailed Calculations box, the results will appear as follows:

### Acid/Base Addition Model

The next model is used to achieve a specified pH, given water sample data. The results appear on the right.
